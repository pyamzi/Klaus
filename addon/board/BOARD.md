### K-001: Manual-verify PDF drive and deck-curate surfaces in live Anki
owner: -
priority: P1
tags: needs-human
verify: human confirms each checklist item in Anki
created: 2026-08-23

Only a human can do this: it needs a running Anki with a real collection.

Checklist:
- Toolbar shows the PDFs link; it opens the drive window and re-raises on second click.
- Drive tree lists imported PDFs; folder create/move/rename and display-rename survive a restart.
- Double-click opens a PDF in the right pane with annotations intact.
- Retention columns populate; Embed runs with progress and can be cancelled; the threshold slider re-aggregates live.
- Deck browser shows the Curate Deck button; dropping a PDF imports and arms it without Anki's own importer opening.
- Curate at root offers the all-decks/specific chooser; inside a deck it scopes silently.

Report failures as new cards rather than fixing them here.

#### Comments
- [2026-08-23 Pouya] PDF viewer just doesn't work at all. It's not even opening. I can't figure out exactly how to. It's not easy to understand the model installation process for a curation or an embedded model, so that needs to be fixed as well.
- [2026-08-23 Pouya] PDF shows up at the top. It just doesn't open into anything, like it doesn't open a window or anything.

### K-006: Slice klausmate/__init__.py into modules

5,980 lines in one file. Too large for one card — the orchestrator must slice it into file-disjoint pieces first, or every worker collides on the same path.

Blocked on grooming, not on skill. Candidate seams: the Manage models dialog (~1000 lines), the editor panel and PDF bar, the Browse toolbar toggles, hook registration and bootstrap.

### K-002: Visual polish pass: Manage models dialog and Klaus panel

verify: designer sign-off; screenshots attached to this card
created: 2026-08-23

Needs a design spec before any code. The Manage models dialog was reorganised by job (What Klaus uses / Local model library) but never got a visual pass. The Klaus panel still uses Bootstrap-era defaults.

Designer: write the spec into this card, then move it to Ready. Do not hand this to a worker un-specced.

### K-009: Make model setup for curation and embeddings understandable

verify: designer sign-off against the spec in this card
created: 2026-08-23

Pouya, on K-001: 'It's not easy to understand the model installation process for a curation or an embedded model.'

This is the second time this surface has been called confusing — the Manage models dialog was reorganised by job on 2026-08-23 for the same reason, and it clearly did not go far enough. The remaining gap is the install/provisioning path rather than the assignment path: what has to be downloaded, what it costs, what a key is for, and what happens if you skip it.

Designer: write the spec into this card before anyone touches code. Worth covering — what the user sees when no embedding model is installed and they press Index cards; whether Voyage-by-default is discoverable at all before it fails; how pulling a local embedding model is offered; and what distinguishes the Ask engine from the search provider in the user's mind, given both are 'models'.

Not sonnet-safe. Needs a spec first.

### K-022: The PDFs button at the top still does not open anything.
owner: sonnet-p
priority: P1
tags: sonnet-safe
files: klausmate/pdf_drive.py
verify: grep -q 'self.show()' klausmate/pdf_drive.py && python3 tests/test_imports.py

claimed: 2026-08-23

Pouya, after restarting Anki: the PDFs toolbar button still opens nothing. Root cause found by orchestrator code-reading, confirmed twice-over by prior evidence (K-008 ruled out import/setup errors; open_drive's except-with-showWarning never fired, so nothing raises):

DriveWindow NEVER SHOWS ITSELF. aqt.dialogs.open() constructs a new instance via the registered creator and stores it — it does not call show(); every Anki dialog calls self.show() in its own __init__ (see Browser/AddCards in the aqt source). So the click builds a complete window that stays invisible. The existing reopen() only helps a window that was shown once.

Fix, all in klausmate/pdf_drive.py:
1. End of DriveWindow.__init__ (after _restore_geometry/rebuild): self.show() + self.raise_() + self.activateWindow(), try/excepted per house style.
2. Related defect, fix in the same pass: user_files/drive.json currently holds window.splitter [46, 46] — closeEvent saved sizes() from the never-shown window, i.e. garbage. Guard BOTH ends: _restore_geometry must ignore splitter sizes that are absurd (e.g. either pane < 120px → fall back to the default split), and closeEvent must not persist sizes when the window was never visible (isVisible() check) or sizes are degenerate.
3. reopen() should also defensively show()+raise_() in case the stored instance is hidden.

Do NOT edit user_files/drive.json itself — it is user data and the restore guard makes stale values harmless.

Done when: the gate passes, imports pass, and the handoff explains where show() landed and how the splitter guard decides.

### K-017: Align the add pdf thing to the bottom, right above the four buttons.

REWORK — Pouya checked in live Anki after the first attempt: 'This was not done properly, the add pdf square is still aligned to the top. I want it aligned to the bottom, above the four buttons.'

Attempt #1 (kept in history, commit 03219da): deferred layout.addWidget(panel) by one tick so the bar appends last to editor.widget.layout(). The position did not change, so appending last to THAT layout does not put the bar at the visual bottom — wrong container, or that layout does not own the vertical order we care about.

New approach — target the host window, not the editor's internal layout: from editor.widget, walk up parents to the top-level window (AddCards). Find the layout that directly contains the window's bottom button box (QDialogButtonBox / the widget holding History/Help/Close/Add), and insertWidget the Klaus panel into THAT layout at the index just before the button box. Fall back to the current editor-layout append if the walk fails (guarded, logged), so Browse/EditCurrent hosts — which have different bottoms — keep working as today.

Investigate before coding: print/log the widget tree once if needed (temporary, removed before commit) is NOT possible headlessly — instead read aqt/addcards.py in the Anki source tree conceptually via CLAUDE.md's guidance: generated forms show setupUi only, Anki mutates layouts afterwards; grep the aqt source strings if useful. State your layout reasoning explicitly in the handoff since nobody can see the window until Pouya restarts Anki.

Keep attempt #1's deferral if still needed for construction-order safety, or revert it if superseded — your call, justify it.

Done when: imports pass, compile passes, and the handoff explains exactly which layout now hosts the bar and at what index. Card stops in Review for Pouya's visual check, same as before.

#### Comments
- [2026-08-23 sonnet-n] Decisions: I read the code differently than the card's literal pointer. The _KlausmatePanel.__init__ 'outer' QVBoxLayout at __init__.py (outer.addWidget(self._pdf_bar), now line 4370) only ever holds that one widget — it's trivially already first/last, nothing to reorder there. The real placement is decided where the whole panel (which just wraps the bar) gets attached to the ACTUAL editor layout: layout.addWidget(panel) inside on_editor_did_init (now line 5786), where layout = editor.widget.layout() — that's the fieldsArea layout that sits directly above the Add window's buttonBox row. That call ran synchronously inside editor_did_init, i.e. before Editor.__init__ necessarily finishes building out editor.widget's own layout. This file already has a documented precedent for exactly this race: _install_panel (a few lines below) is deferred via QTimer.singleShot(0, ...) specifically because 'the window's layout is fully constructed' only after one event-loop tick. I applied the same fix: wrapped the panel-creation-and-addWidget block in a new _install_klaus_bar() closure and scheduled it with QTimer.singleShot(0, _install_klaus_bar), so it now runs after Anki finishes constructing the rest of that layout, guaranteeing our bar is appended last. Files: klausmate/__init__.py — only the on_editor_did_init function changed (added _install_klaus_bar, deferred the existing 4-line block into it unchanged, added a try/except RuntimeError for the case the widget is gone by the time the timer fires). Nothing else in the layout was reordered; the two lines that set _klausmate_target_field_index/_klausmate_active_pdf defaults stayed synchronous since nothing depends on timing there. Risks: Qt widgets can't be instantiated in this repo's offscreen test harness (see .claude/skills/klaus-test), so I could not empirically confirm this was the actual root cause of the misplacement vs. some other layout detail I'm not seeing — please eyeball the Add window after restarting Anki, specifically that the 'Drop lecture PDF here' bar sits directly above the History/Help/Close/Add row with nothing (e.g. stray whitespace or another widget) between them. Also worth confirming the PDF bar still shows up immediately (not with a visible flash/delay) since it now waits one 0ms timer tick before appearing — should be imperceptible but flag it if not. Next: none identified beyond the visual check this card already calls for.
- [2026-08-23 orchestrator] Code review passed: minimal deferred-install change with a defensive RuntimeError guard, mirroring the established _install_panel pattern; compiles through the symlink; imports green. The worker's disagreement with my grooming was correct — the card pointed at outer.addWidget inside _KlausmatePanel, which only ever holds one widget; the real ordering happens at layout.addWidget(panel) in on_editor_did_init, and that is what was deferred. HOLDING IN REVIEW: position is visual. Pouya — restart Anki, open the Add window, and check the 'Drop lecture PDF here' bar now sits at the very bottom, directly above History/Help/Close/Add. Move to Done if right; comment and move to Doing if not.
- [2026-08-23 Pouya] This was not done properly, the add pdf square is still aligned to the top. I want it aligned to the bottom, above the four buttons.
